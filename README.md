### This repo contain some of my re-implement of playing atari games with reinforcement learning
#### [07/10/2023] Play Pong Game
* Playing atari pong game from openai Gym use Q-learning and experience replay memory [2].
* The implementation base on [Shubham Lohiya[1]](https://github.com/shubhlohiya/playing-atari-with-deep-RL) and references from [juliankappler [3]]( https://github.com/juliankappler/lunar-lander)

* Run `python play_pong.py`
##### Training result
